The goal of mklcustom is to provide some convenience functions for myself, Marian Klose.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mklcustom from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("klosinho00/mklcustom")
```

So far this is only intended to be used privately by my own.
